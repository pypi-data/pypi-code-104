        format_params : Optional[dict]

        sql_file_path : Optional[str]
            The `sql_file_path` is expected to be set if the user has written a custom SQL query. A standard filepath will be used in the case where
            the user wants to use the default SQL query.
        bucket_name : Optional[str]
            The standard `bucket_name` for the medical images are already given as default although other specific buckets are likely to be in other
